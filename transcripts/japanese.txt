Hi everyone, it's Naoko. What did you do yesterday? Today, I'm going to talk about what I did yesterday. It's a challenge to see how much you can understand. Let's go! I woke up at around 8am yesterday, washed my face, brushed my teeth, put on makeup, changed my clothes, and drank a cup of water. I don't usually eat breakfast. When I was in high school, I often ate breakfast. For example, miso soup, rice, bread. And I often ate leftovers from the dinner the day before. But I don't eat breakfast at all these days. I washed my face and brushed my teeth. And around 9am, I went to my relative's field. In the morning, I worked a little in the field. I sowed beets seeds. Beets are red vegetables. I sowed a lot of seeds, so I'm looking forward to eating them. And I went home for lunch. What did I eat yesterday? Oh, pasta. I made tomato sauce, anchovy, and cheese pasta. My friend came over, so I made a lot. Tomato sauce, cheese, and anchovy. This combination is the best. It's really delicious. And after eating lunch, I went to a cafe. I went to a cafe by car. Do you like driving a car? I didn't like it very much. I liked taking the train. But recently, I like driving a car. In the afternoon, I went to a cafe to drink coffee In the afternoon, I went to a cafe to drink coffee and studied Japanese and Spanish. Yes, Japanese. I'm Japanese, but I think Japanese is difficult these days, so I'm studying Japanese. It's difficult. And before I went home, I went to the supermarket. Around 5 p.m.? When I go to the supermarket in the evening, they sell half-price sashimi, karaage, and onigiri. But I didn't buy anything yesterday. I went home around 6 p.m. And for dinner, I ate a Japanese dish called chikuzen-ni. It has carrots, lotus root, and chicken. It's a little sweet. It was delicious. And after dinner, I washed the dishes, wiped the dishes, and folded the laundry. I did a little housework. And after that, I edited YouTube videos and wrote a blog. And after that, I took a bath. I took a shower. Of course, I brushed my teeth. And I went to bed around 11 p.m. and looked at my cell phone. I think I watched Netflix, Instagram, news, and YouTube for about an hour. And I went to bed between 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. That's all. Did you get it? How much did you understand? It would be great if you could understand everything. 問題 シャワーを浴びる 洗濯物を畳む 歯を磨く 運転する 洗濯する 歯を磨く 洗濯する 運転する 洗濯物を畳む シャワーを浴びる お疲れ様でした。 最後まで見てくれて本当にありがとうございます。 じゃ、またねー。
